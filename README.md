# 10 BIT ADC
Main idea of this project is,the device only manage barrier between analog and digital world we need device called ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTOR.with the 10 bit adc with input voltage 3.3v,output digital voltage 1.8v  &1 off chip external voltage reference using osu 018 library,studied here.
# set up informatiom
* firstly we have Esim software in windows or ubuntu for windows fot that link https://esim.fossee.in/home
* create a new project :the new project is created when we click on new project icon.
* creating schematic: to create a create new schematic we find icon has open schematic ,click on it.
* now we have place the tools we required 
* for finding the components we have click in ur keyboard A button to select components .
* now save your schematic by ctrl+s.
* after that we have perform a erc rule(electric rule check)'
* here if we find errors by click run erc file and debug by seeing the errors.
* now we have to generate netlist file for kicad in .cir file.
* after that we have to convert kicad to ngspice by clicking on it 
* we find different analysis,device modeling,subcircuits,ngspice model.
* after all these parameters we given then convert it.
* for ngspice netlist in the form of .cir.out.
* for simulation we have select the simulator in this we find two plotings 1.normal 2.python ploting
