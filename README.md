# 10 BIT ADC
the Main idea of this project is that device only manage barrier between analog and digital world. so,we need a device called ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTOR. the 10 bit adc with input voltage of 3.3v,output digital voltage of 1.8v  and one off chip external voltage reference using @osu180nm library,studied here.
# Installing ESim  in ubuntu os: 
*  To download esim  for ubuntu os http://esim.fossee.in/downloads to our directory files.
* to install esim software we have to run the following commands
  * $ cd esim-2.0
  * $ chmod +x install-esim.sh
  * ./install-esim.sh --install
# installing Esim in windows os:
*  To download the esim-2.0 installer.exe from  http://esim.fossee.in/downloads.
* after that double click on .exe file  for start installation  click on yes button.
*  generally it installed in c drive,in that automatically generated fossie folder.
* esim icon created on your desktop by double clicking on it opens.
# getting started with esim:
* create a new project:the new project is created when we click on new project icon.
![creating new project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66682399/84471796-b5533f80-aca3-11ea-8e34-e352c47ef2e3.PNG)
* creating schematic: to  create new schematic we find icon as open schematic ,click on it.
* ![open schmeatic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66682399/84471978-13802280-aca4-11ea-9d81-94ff5f235b77.PNG)
* now we have place the tools we required .
* ![open components](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66682399/84472019-2a267980-aca4-11ea-82b8-2cfff3c8e4d7.PNG)
* for finding the components we have to click in your keyboard A button to select components .
* then save your schematic by ctrl+s.
* after save the schematic 
* after that we have to perform a erc rule(electric rule check).
* ![erc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66682399/84472620-2515fa00-aca5-11ea-91b9-076dd6736fcf.PNG)
* here if we find errors by click run erc file and debug by seeing the errors.
* now we have to generate netlist file for kicad in .cir file.
* after that we have to convert kicad to ngspice by clicking on it .
* we find different analysis,device modeling,subcircuits,ngspice model.
* after all these parameters we given then convert it.
for ngspice netlist in the form of .cir.out.
* for simulation we have select the simulator, 
then simulator runs we get waveforms.
* in that we find two plotings 1.normal 2.python ploting observe the waveforms in any of the plotings.
